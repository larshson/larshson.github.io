# HHC2023

The purpose of this repository is to host writeups for the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2023.

The only writeup to get produced this year though, is a detailed technical description on how to solve the challenge `Linux 101`, but doing it in a totally unintended way.

It involves exploiting multiple weaknesses in the challenge as well as some reversing. It ends with a root shell and an investigation of how a challenge is being reported as completed. It turns out it is done using specially formatted `#####hhc:{}#####` strings sent over the websocket associated with the terminal.

Enjoy!
